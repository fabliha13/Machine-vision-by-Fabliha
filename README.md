**Face Detection and Distance Measurement with OpenCV**: 
This project utilizes OpenCV to detect faces in a video stream and measure the distance between the detected faces and the camera. The main objective is to provide a real-time demonstration of face detection and distance measurement using computer vision techniques.

Features:
Face detection using the Haar Cascade classifier,
Real-time video stream processing,
Measurement of distance between detected faces and the camera,
Display of face position and distance information on the video stream.

Requirements:
Python 3.x,
OpenCV library (cv2),
Haar Cascade XML file for face detection.
